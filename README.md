# GitHub Chapter 2 Sandbox

Welcome to my sandbox repository for practicing Git and GitHub concepts from Codédex Chapter 2!

## 📂 About This Project

This project is based on the Codédex curriculum and serves as a playground for experimenting with Git commands, branching, pull requests, and collaboration workflows.

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Forked the original Codédex Chapter 2 repository
- Cloned the repo to my local machine
- Created and switched to a new branch `nikpiao-dev/edit`
- Made updates and customizations to explore Git functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

To work with this project on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikpiao-dev/github-chapter-2-sandbox.git
cd github-chapter-2-sandbox
git checkout nikpiao-dev/edit
